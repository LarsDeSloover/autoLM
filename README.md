# autoLM: AI-Driven Collective Response Synthesis

**autoLM** is an innovative web-based tool designed to synthesize responses from groups of participants using generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). It facilitates more efficient and inclusive group discussions by leveraging the OpenAI API to process and analyze multiple individual responses to open-ended questions. 

The tool is particularly valuable for educational settings, enabling instructors to quickly identify shared themes, unique contributions, and divergent perspectives. This document provides an overview of the project setup and highlights where configuration changes are necessary for deployment.

## **Setup Instructions**

There are two ways to use autoLM:

### **1. Hosted Option**
- Create an account at **[https://autolm.ugent.be](https://autolm.ugent.be)** to start using the platform immediately.

### **2. Local Setup (Custom Deployment)**
If you'd like to build your own instance of autoLM, follow these steps:

#### **Database Configuration**
Update the database connection parameters in `include/db.inc.php`:

```php
<?php
$conn_string = "host=localhost port=1234 dbname=your_dbname user=your_user_name password=yoursecretpassword";
$GLOBALS['dbconn'] = pg_connect($conn_string) or die("Could not connect");
?>
```
- Replace the placeholders:
  - `localhost`: Database host.
  - `1234`: Port for the database server.
  - `your_dbname`: Name of your database.
  - `your_user_name`: Database username.
  - `yoursecretpassword`: Database password.

#### **API Key Configuration**
Update the OpenAI API key in `include/startphp.inc.php`:

```php
<?php
session_start(); 
include('db.inc.php');
include('functions.inc.php');
$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
?>
```
- Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key.

#### **OpenAI API Parameters**
Configure the OpenAI API parameters in `ajax/admin/answer.php`:

```php
<?php
// The endpoint for the GPT model, adjust as necessary
$url = 'https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions';

// Prepare your prompt with the survey responses
$messages = [
    [
        "role" => "system",
        "content" => "You are a helpful assistant."
    ],
    [
        "role" => "user",
        "content" => $prompt
    ]
];

// Configure your request payload
$data = [
    "model" => "gpt-4o-mini", // Update model as needed
    "messages" => $messages,
    "max_tokens" => 200
];
?>
```
- Adjust the `model`, `max_tokens`, or other settings to suit your use case.

#### **Server Deployment**
1. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   - Ensure your server has PHP and PostgreSQL installed.
   - Set up the database using your own schema.

2. **Deploy Files**:
   - Upload all project files to your server.

3. **Verify Configuration**:
   - Ensure the `db.inc.php` and `startphp.inc.php` files are correctly configured.
   - Test database and API connectivity.

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Open the application via the `index.php` entry point.
   - Example URL: `https://your-domain.com/index.php`
